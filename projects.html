            <p class="list-group-item-text moreText">
            The challenge on this project was to provide superior, uniform high end sound throughout the space with minimal visual impact and without the need for an experienced audio engineer to run the system. Fortunately, The Yamaha Commercial Installed Solutions (CIS) product line was created specifically for situations like this where there may not be an experienced audio operator running the system.<br><br>
            &quot;We knew that this system needed to be high end and sound crystal clear at all listening levels, while maintaining the aesthetics of the space,&quot; states Aaron Jackson, Audio Visual Technical Engineer, at Tulalip Casino.<br><br>
            The wide dispersion of the Yamaha CIS speakers allowed this to be accomplished without cluttering the ceiling with a lot of speakers. Surface mounted speakers were used for the entry and placed between suspended ceiling panels. The Yamaha speakers are compact enough to be completely hidden, offering pleasing sound with a very low visual impact.<br><br>
            &quot;Our Destinations Lounge system sounds amazing through the entire spectrum and has beautifully uniform coverage in every seat. We have come to expect that when we buy a Yamaha product; it’s going to work, it’s going to look great, and it’s going to sound amazing. Bottom line for us is, Yamaha has struck the perfect balance of price and quality.&quot; Aaron Jackson, Audio Visual Technical Engineer, at Tulalip Casino.</p>

              The Tulalip Resort Casino in Tulalip, Washington wanted to upgrade their 480-seat Canoes Cabaret nightly entertainment lounge to a full 7.1 surround sound system and a NEXO line array system.

              Clarity Media Group was able to simplify the design that had been developed by another vendor which not only reduced the cost but also enhanced signal integrity.
              Clarity Media Group uses a simplistic and precise approach to design and installation.</p>
            <p class="moreText list-group-item-text quoted">
              &#34;If a component, such as an additional DSP, can be omitted from the signal chain, that will help maintain a more natural sound. Systems that rely on extensive signal processing have a harsher sound which is less pleasing to the ear. We believe that if you design the system correctly in the first place it will not need to be processed at all, resulting in a more natural sound that is very pleasing to the ear.&#34; <br> &#126;Travis Cibolski, co-owner of Clarity Media Group</p>
            <h5 class="moreText subheader" id="afterQuote">The modified design developed by Clarity Media Group consisted of&#58;</h5>

            </ul>
            <p class="moreText list-group-item-text">
              One of the challenges with this design for this space is that the bartenders in the back of the lounge had trouble hearing people order because of the volume level with the previous system. Careful design and placement of the GEO S12 cabinets made it possible to control and manipulate the SPL throughout the room resulting in a uniform sound level in the main area while ate the same time dropping the SPL 3db in the bar area. Needless to say, the bartenders have been very happy with the change.<br><br>
              Another challenge was that the Casino management wanted to avoid having too much sub bass in the main entrance area. To achieve this, Clarity Media Group used the cardioid qualities of the RS18 to steer sub bass away from the entrance while providing powerful bass response in the listening area.<br><br>
              Presently the room does not utilize a monitor console. However, because all of the components are networked via EtherSound including amps, it will be very easy to add a monitor desk down the road. One additional feature is that you can control the entire system directly from an iPad.<br><br>
              The upgrade the Casino wanted included not only sound but video as well. The new design by Clarity Media Group included four Dalite screens systems. The main screen is a 1.5 gain, 18 ft wide tensioned electrol. The projectors are all Eiki 1080p projectors and just like the sound system they can be controlled via an iPad. With the new enhanced screens and projectors, the casino has been able to add sporting events with different games on various screens, increasing the usability of the space which has increased patronage and revenues.
